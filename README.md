This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and testing of a small home network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network represents a realistic residential environment with multiple rooms, end devices, intermediary devices, and internet connectivity through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

The objective of this project is to connect multiple wired and wireless devices, configure a home wireless router, enable automatic IP addressing (DHCP), and verify end-to-end connectivity to the internet.
